# Bugs Fixed

## Summary
Fixed 2 critical bugs in the EABC to Ace Studio encoder and set up complete deployment infrastructure.

## Bug #1: Function Signature Mismatch
**Location**: Line 124 (now 131)  
**Issue**: `pitchToMidi` function was called with 2 parameters (pitch, key) but defined to accept only 1 parameter.

**Impact**: The key signature was being passed but completely ignored, leading to incorrect pitch calculations for songs in keys with sharps or flats.

**Fix**: Updated function signature to accept `key` parameter and added logic to apply key signature accidentals:
```javascript
const pitchToMidi = (pitch, key) => {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Apply key signature accidentals
  if (key && key.includes('#') && key[0] === note) {
    midiNote++;
  } else if (key && key.includes('b') && key[0] === note) {
    midiNote--;
  }
  
  // ... rest of code ...
}
```

## Bug #2: Metadata Lines Processed as Notes
**Location**: Line 40  
**Issue**: The second `forEach` loop that processes notes didn't skip metadata lines (T:, C:, M:, L:, K:, Q:), meaning metadata could be incorrectly parsed as musical notes.

**Impact**: Could cause unexpected notes to be generated from metadata text, corrupt the timing, or cause parsing errors.

**Fix**: Added check to skip all metadata lines in the note processing loop:
```javascript
lines.forEach(line => {
  // Skip metadata lines
  if (line.startsWith('T:') || line.startsWith('C:') || 
      line.startsWith('M:') || line.startsWith('L:') || 
      line.startsWith('K:') || line.startsWith('Q:')) {
    return;
  }
  // ... process notes ...
});
```

## Deployment Setup
Created complete deployment infrastructure:
- ✅ Renamed file to proper `.jsx` extension
- ✅ Created `package.json` with all dependencies (React, pako, lucide-react)
- ✅ Set up Vite build system
- ✅ Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
- ✅ Created proper project structure (`src/`, entry points)
- ✅ Added Dockerfile for containerized deployment
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation (README.md, DEPLOYMENT.md)
- ✅ Tested build process - **builds successfully**

## Deployment Status
✅ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

The application can now be deployed using:
- Docker: `docker build -t eabc-encoder . && docker run -p 8080:80 eabc-encoder`
- Netlify/Vercel: `npm run build` then deploy `dist` folder
- Any static hosting: Upload `dist` folder after building

## Test Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Use the example input from `EXAMPLE_INPUT.txt`
4. Verify conversion works and downloads function correctly
